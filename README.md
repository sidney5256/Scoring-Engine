# Scoring-Engine
The goal here is to build a hypothetical scoring engine for sales leads. The higher the score, the hotter the lead. Your application will be run from the command line and will accept a CSV file path as input. Your CSV file input will have the following layout for each line:

contact id - integer
event - string
score - decimal
